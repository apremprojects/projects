**Here is a comprehensive record of all of my projects for my expeditions**
Round 1
1. IMU Data visualizer
    a. Uses OpenGL and Qt to display data
2. PID tuner
    a. Uses OpenGL and Qt to help the user tune my robot's PIDs, and calculate the ideal values for optimal performance.
3. Motion Commands
    a. Uses a command line interface to make the robot perform a sequence of actions (eg. set the left wheel to speed X and right wheel to Y for Z seconds, etc.)
4. Joystick control demo
    a. Control the two-wheeled robot with conventional joystick mechanics - like a video game or toy car - over bluetooth.
        a. Uses a standard Bluetooth controller, in my case, an XBox controller.
